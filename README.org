* Magit Iconify
Make your Magit buffers look iconic ðŸ’…

#+begin_quote
[!NOTE]
This library is no longer needed, iconification is now built into Magit as of https://github.com/magit/magit/commit/223461b52c35b0f426c053f4c6e7e7637c4a9b73

The only difference for =magit-iconify= is that I handle directories as well as files.

** Preview
*** Status Buffer
[[./images/status-buffer.png]]
*** Diff Stat buffer
[[./images/diffstat-buffer.png]]

** Installation
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package magit-iconify
    :straight (:type git :host github :repo "justinbarclay/magit-iconify")
    :hook (magit-mode . magit-iconify-mode))
#+end_src
** Features
- Supports both all-the-icons and nerd-icons
- Only external dependency is [[https://github.com/magit/magit][magit]]
- Brittle as heck.
- Customizable icon function

** Customization
You can customize the icon generation function using =magit-iconify-fn=. =magit-iconify-fn= should handle a single string representing a file or directory and return a string in return.

*warning* this means that we can't support vscode-icons because it returns a reference to an image.
#+begin_src elisp
  (setopt magit-iconify-fn (lambda (file) (nerd-icons-icon-for-file file)))
#+end_src

  - I used this project as a source of inspiration.
